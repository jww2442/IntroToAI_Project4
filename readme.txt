For the neural net, run main.py. Any of the parameters (# hidden nodes, # hidden layers, # input nodes, # classes) can be altered. 
However # input nodes and # classes must match the dataset used. I have already set it up so any of the datasets can be run without altering any parameter; Just delete the indicated '#' in main.py. 

For the supervised_learner (the decision tree learner), just execute the learn_tree.py method. the code is at the bottom. you can change the 'use_entropy_instead_of_gini_index' boolean function to run the entropy measure or gini index splitting functions.
